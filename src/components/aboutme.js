        <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>My name is Anna Williamson, I am 23 years old, and I was born and raised in San Diego, California. I would describe myself as confident, intelligent, creative, empathetic, self-aware, hard-working, and passionate. I love to camp, hike, go to the beach, garden, and in general, be outdoors. I also love to travel, am a bit of an adrenaline junkie, and love to try new foods and recipes. 

          </p>

          <p> I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in June 2019 with a B.S. in Anthropology and Geography, concentrating in Environmental Studies and Sustainability. I also minored in Spanish and Political Science. My interest in Web Development was sparked by my experiences using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies and applications in college and in my first position after graduating. I am passionate about using GIS and remote sensing technologies to promote sustainable environmental management and city planning.
